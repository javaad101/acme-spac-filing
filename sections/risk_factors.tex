\subsection{Our business model may not be successful.}
The nature of a SPAC is inherently high-risk. We have \deleted[id=JH]{no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.} \added[id=JH]{not yet identified a business combination target and may never do so.} Our ability to effect a business combination and realize a return on your investment is entirely dependent upon the efforts of our management team.

\subsection{Our initial business combination may not be completed.}
We may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the required time frame. If we fail to complete a business combination by \replaced[id=JW]{February 1, 2028}{December 31, 2027}, we will be required to dissolve and liquidate our trust account. In that event, the redemption price per share will be approximately $\$10.00$, and your warrants will expire worthless.

\subsection{Risk to Warrant Holders}
Warrant holders may not be able to exercise their warrants prior to the expiration date. \added[id=JH]{The warrants may be redeemed by us at any time, subject to certain conditions.} This creates a significant risk of forfeiture.
